# TDD Exercises

This repository is a starter project for our exercises. 

You'll need a [jdk 8+](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)

and an IDE like [eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/installer)

Once you hava a jdk and IDE installed,
1. Clone the repo
2. Open the GettingStartedTest class
3. Run as junit
4. You should get 1 failing test with the message: "You are all set!"

That's it. You are now ready to work through the exercises.
